Problem 1.
6 * 2 + 9 * 2 + 20 * 1 = 50
6 * 4 + 9 * 3 + 20 * 0 = 51
6 * 2 + 9 * 0 + 20 * 2 = 52
6 * 1 + 9 * 3 + 20 * 1 = 53
6 * 3 + 9 * 4 + 20 * 0 = 54
6 * 1 + 9 * 1 + 20 * 2 = 55

it is possible to buy 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 sets of McNuggets,
given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20 packs,
then it is possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= 50.
